# Toxic BERT Classification

This repository contains a project using a BERT-based model for toxicity classification. The project aims to classify text data based on its toxicity level using natural language processing techniques.


## Project Description

Toxic BERT Classification uses a pre-trained BERT model to identify toxic comments from text data. The model is fine-tuned on a specific dataset to enhance its performance in toxicity detection tasks.


## Notebook Details

The provided notebook, `toxic-bert-plain-vanila.ipynb`, contains the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset.
   - Preprocess the text data for the BERT model.

2. **Model Setup:**
   - Configure and load the pre-trained BERT model.
   - Fine-tune the model on the toxicity dataset.

3. **Training:**
   - Train the model on the training data.
   - Evaluate the model on the validation data.

4. **Inference:**
   - Use the trained model to classify new text data.
   - Output predictions and analyze the results.
